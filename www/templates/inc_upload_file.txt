<h3>Upload some dots</h3>
<p class="caveat" style="text-align:left;">At the moment, <strong>only comma-separated (CSV) files are supported</strong> and only the first {$cfg.upload_max_records|escape} records in a file will be imported. For all the details about uploading data into Dotspotting, <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}/faq/#uploads">click here</a>.</p>

<p class="caveat" style="text-align:left;"><strong>All dots are made public by default.</strong> You can override this behaviour in your CSV file by including a <code>perms</code> column and assign the relevant rows a value of <q>private</q> or by ticking the <q>make all these dots private</q> checkbox below. There is currently no way to toggle privacy settings for individual dots but that be done shortly.</p>

<p class="caveat" style="text-align:left;">You should not consider any data you put in to Dotspotting to be permanent. <strong>Yet.</strong> Dotspotting is still very much a work in motion and we may need to purge data or simply make mistakes before we bless the whole thing as <q>stable</q>.</p>
