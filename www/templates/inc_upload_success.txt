<p>We did encounter a few errors along the way, though. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
{foreach from=$upload.errors item="row"}
<li>Record number <strong>{$row.record|escape}</strong>: <q>{$row.error|escape}</q></li>
{/foreach}
</ul>
{/if}
{/if}

<h3><a href="{$upload.sheet|@urls_url_for_sheet}" class="blue_links">View your sheet now</a></h3>

{if $upload.dots_received != $upload.dots_processed}

<p><strong>But!</strong> Not all of the dots you uploaded could be processed. Of the {$upload.dots_received|escape} dots you uploaded only {$upload.dots_processed|escape} were able to be imported in to dotspotting. The following errors were reported:</p> 

<ul>
{foreach from=$upload.errors item="row"}
<li>Record number <strong>{$row.record|escape}</strong>: <q>{$row.error|escape}</q></li>
{/foreach}
</ul>

{/if}
