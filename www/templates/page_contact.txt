<p>Dotspotting is designed and maintained by <a href="http://stamen.com/">Stamen Design</a> in San Francisco. The project is the first initiative of Citytracking, a project funded by the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2010/11/citytracking-presents-data-on-cities-for-maps-visualizations302.html">Knight News Challenge</a>. We're making tools to help people gather data about cities and make that data more legible. Our hope is to do this in a way that's simple enough for regular people to get involved, but robust enough for real research to happen along the way.</p>

<p>We welcome your feedback! Mail us at <a href="mailto:dotspotting@stamen.com">dotspotting@stamen.com</a> and we'll get back to you just as soon as we can.</p>
