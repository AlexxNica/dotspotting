	# FILE. YOUR SECRETS SHOULD BE STORED OUTSIDE OF (INSERT YOUR SOURCE CONTROL SYSTEM HERE)
	#

	#
	# Any settings you define here will overwrite settings in the dotspotting include/config.php.
	# 
	# Which means two things:
	#
	# 1) Not all of the config parameters you may want or need to tweak are listed here. Only the bare
	#    minimum needed to get you started.
	#
	# 2) dotspotting's include/config.php itself overwrites settings in the flamework include/config.php
	#
	#    Specifically, in (dotspotting) include/init.php the following files are loaded in this order:
	#
	#    a) flamework's include/config.php
	#    b) dotspotting's include/config.php
	#    c) dotspotting's secrets/dotspotting.php <-- aka "the file you are reading right now"
	#
	# There is a file containing *all* of the configs that dotspotting uses (including those defined
	# in flamework) in [TBW]
	#

	#
	# You MUST change these
	#

	# If you have the various db_enable_poormans_* config flags set (they are on by default in
	# dotspotting) you don't need to worry about configs for the 'db_main_slaves', 'db_users'
	# and 'db_tickets' database clusters. The db_enable_poormans_* flags will auto-populate the
	# corresponding database configs automagically. If you disable the 'poorman' flags, you will
	# need to add the relevant database configs here, though.

	# No, really - change these. These are the secrets used to encrypt the various pieces of sensitive
	# data on your website. These aren't secrets that you'll ever need to type in to a form so you
	# should make them long and twisty and hard to guess (a good rule of thumb is 13 or more characters
	# of gibberish).
